# ~> 5.10 tells Bundler that we want a version of at least 5.10 of minitest, but prior to version 6.0: thus, 5.10.0, 5.11.7, and 5.12.10 will be okay, but not version 6.0.0 or higher.
gem 'minitest', '~> 5.10'
gem 'minitest-reporters', '~> 1.1'
# Note that we don't need to add a gem 'date' statement: date is part of Ruby's standard library; it is not a Gem.
